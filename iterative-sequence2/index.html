<h2>Jungle Escape</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game shows an original map design for a platformer that I designed.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Use of tile maps to design the platformer map.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot about tile maps and the way in which it can be used to create maps and assets
for games.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Map, Character and background: <a href="https://jesse-m.itch.io/jungle-pack">Jungle Assets</a></li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help the lost soldier escape the jungle!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Soldier.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Tilemap usage for map building and gravity and other platformer physics
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Enjoy exploring this relatively simple jungle map as you help control a soldier on his quest to escape the jungle. More levels to follow.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players use the arrow keys to move the character around the map. Left and right arrows move left and right, while the up arrow causes the character to jump.
Using these controls traverse the map, all the while looking for a way out. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There are only so many paths that can be chosen, so working through each will eventually lead to an escape.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A soldier is trapt in the Jungle of a foreign country. Cut off from his team and (relative) safety, he must fight to find a way to get back to where he belongs.
He does not know why, but the jungle cave in which he finds himself makes him very uneasy and fills him with an overwhelming sense of dread. 
While there is nothing visible to him that seems hostile, he can sense that there is something lurking in the dark...
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Fans of platformers
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
3-5 Minutes
