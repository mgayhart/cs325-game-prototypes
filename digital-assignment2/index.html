<h2>Los Pollos Ociosos</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li> This game is rather simple, however the originality comes from the subject matter, designed to encourage the buying of higher tiered chicken related establishments. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>Technically, this game involves a large number of variables, so if there is a change in any one variable the rest of the game reacts accordingly for each business</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li> I learned a lot about the way that variables interact with each other and the ways in which Phaser updates the different aspects of the game as it is played. </li>
<li> The most difficult part of this game was getting each of the variables to act the way I wanted and getting the repeated timed events to act properly.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li> I was inspired by games like Adventure Capitalist, and idle games of the sort.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Make as much money as possible by purchasing businesses starting with just producing eggs, all the way to fine Dining.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Working with timed events and multiple variables tracking aspects of the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I would like players to strategically purchase different businesses in order to make the most money possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Players make money by purchasing different businesses, represented by their pictures. Beginning you can only purchase one egg but eventually will be able to buy more and higher tier businesses. Clicking on the picture of the business will buy one if you have enough money for it.</li>
<li>In the future there would be production bonuses for owning certain amounts of businesses, for example a x2 bonus for owning 100 eggs.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>Players will profit higher from purchasing higher tiered businesses as they go, but not forgetting about the lower and faster earning businesses.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set as a person who has only enough money to purchase some eggs from a farmer, as time progresses they are able to buy more eggs, then chickens, and from there the sky is the limit!
Make as much money as you can, the only thing limiting your profits is the amount of time you want to invest.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Players who would like a casual gaming experience and enjoy the idea of making money and buying businesses.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
As long as the player wants to be earning money; roughly 10 mins.
</li>

</ul>
