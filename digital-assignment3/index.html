<h2>Star Walker</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The idea of traveling through space for leisure but also while avoiding danger
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
There is a great deal of hit boxes to be kept track of as well as the different groups and spawns
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li>I learned about groups and keyboard input and collision mechanics</li>
<li>The hardest part of this game was working with groups and getting them to cooperate</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Travel through space admiring the beauty and avoiding its many dangers.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Stargazer
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard input, Scrolling game, space. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Keyboard input as well as groups and collisions
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to be challenged to attempt to collect as many blue stars as they can and get the highest score possible
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players use the left and right keyboard buttons to maneuver the spaceship through space, with the score increasing both as time passes and when blue stars are collected.

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
While the blue stars give a hefty bonus, they may not always be smart to go after, sometimes survival at the expense of missing
a couple blue stars is worth it in the end.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in the near future, the player is onboard their personal ship, which have replaced cars as the means for travel. They were travelling through the stars when they noticed a more sinister group of stars approaching
these stars would mean certain death if they were to collide. However, the player notices that there are some stars that radiate
goodness and hitting them gives them the sense that life will go on and they can navigate through these dark times. 
Collecting blue stars adds 500 to score, and survival constantly adds score. Good Luck, and enjoy the ride. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who appreciate space, and people who enjoy a casual but competitive game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
As long as you can survive.
