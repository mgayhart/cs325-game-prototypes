<h2>Riddles in the Dark Redux</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
This game is intended to allow the player to feel as if they were in the loved story, "The Hobbit"
as Bilbo, playing a game of riddles with Gollum
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The addition of accepting keystrokes from the user is not something that was already established as far as I could tell.
beyond this the interactivity of the sound effects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? I learned a lot about the gamestate model of phaser as well as accepting text, and 
bitmaps
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
The hardest part beyond the game states, and figuring out when you need a this.
was the fact that there were a lot of pieces to debug and things would crash if not correct.
Another hard part was modifying the concept of typing input and allowing the player to print that to the screen

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>The code for this example is adapted from the <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/v2.6.2/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic">Phaser Basic Project Template</a></li>
<li>There are several Phaser examples that were helpful references, the audio completion example, for sound, and bitmap data for assistance with the bitmap
then the input keystroke example was modified to allow for user input for answers to the riddle.</li> 
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The player solves riddles to escape the evil creature, Gollum
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The Hobbit.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Text Input
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To allow for player to enter text as a means of controlling the game
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to feel like they are in Bilbo's shoes and having to play a game of riddles with Gollum. 
I want it to seem like Gollum is coming out of their computer through the speakers.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Players use the keyboard to answer the riddles given by the window. Solving the riddles gets the player closer to escape. The next step for the game is to show a meter to show the player
how close to the end they are, and could replace the strike markers at the top.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Using logic to help in solving the riddles, or knowledge of the Hobbit riddle answers.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is based in the World of Middle Earth, which was created by J.R.R. Tolkien. This 
begins deep under the Misty Mountains where Bilbo has gotten lost and has run into the 
creature, Gollum, who says that they can play a game of riddles to see if he will eat 
Bilbo or show him the way out of the maze like tunnels beneath the mountains. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who is a fan of riddles or The Hobbit.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
5-10 minutes
</li>
